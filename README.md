# BesselFunctions
A set of resolutions of Bessel equations in R.

I coded the Bessel function of order 0 which is the only one that has value 1 at t = 0.
Then I will generalize the Bessel equation of order k,
but for this I need to check the values of the derivatives in J[k]'(0).
We know that J[k]'(0) = (J[k-1] - J[k+1])/2.
